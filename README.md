## DH150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation by Felician Crisostomo

For my UX design project, I would like to contribute to the health and fitness community at UCLA. Currently there are many students who want to keep track of their health but do not have a tailored app and digital experience to keep track of their fitness goals. I'd like to design something that meets the needs of this community whilst creating a platform that will bring more people into it.

Currently there does not exist one single web/mobile application that combines exercise and calorie logging with the activities and facilities at UCLA. There are third party applications that students can use such as the fitbit app and Bruin Bite to track fitness and check dining hall menus respectively. However it is quite cumbersome to have to switch between such applications. One major user need is the lack of calorie counting functionality on the menu apps, which could potentially be a feature for the app I'd like to design.

## App Evaluation 1: Fitbit App

The Fitbit app is currently the most popular app due to its use in conjunction with the Fitbit tracker fitness band. It has a variety of modules for viewing different aspects of one's health in a clear and concise way. However, I feel that not all of its features are the easiest to access. When I was originally playing around with the app I had to find my way through trial and error. Many things were not as intuitive as I'd like them to be.
